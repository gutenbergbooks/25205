<h2>Our Best Friend</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>N A log cabin in the mountains lived a little
boy. He often played near the house,
but did not go far away. Near the house
were many trees and rocks and among these
wild animals stayed.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 194px;">
<img src="images/lotcp04.jpg" width="194" height="250"

</div>

<p class="caption">DOWN BY THE SPRING</p>

<p>One day the boy missed his mama and
thought he would try to find her. He
went down the path toward the spring, where
he had often gone after water. He went on and
on. Finally he wished to
return, but did not know the way. Poor boy,
he was lost.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg&nbsp;12]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 306px;">
<img src="images/lotcp05.jpg" width="306" height="400"
alt="A boy sits in a window seat, his mother standing behind him." />
</div>

<p class="caption">THE BEST FRIEND WE HAVE IS MOTHER</p>

<p>He started toward what he thought was
home, and walked and walked. Becoming
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg&nbsp;13]</a></span>
very tired, he sat down to rest and soon fell
asleep.</p>

<p>His mama missed her boy and hunted
everywhere for him. Night came on, but
she did not give up her search. She
hunted and called, but no answer came.
She feared the wild beasts would get him,
but prayed to God to protect her child. She
hunted all night and in the morning found
him safe and still asleep.</p>

<p>The best friend we have on earth is a good
mother. She thinks of her children at all
times. She loves them and lives for them.
She seems to know all about our little cares
and trials. When we are willing to help her,
it shows that we think of her and love her,
too.</p>

<p>Have you ever thought how she toils and
cares for you? She works for you every day&mdash;gets
your meals, breakfast, dinner, and
supper; washes and mends your clothes and
stockings; and at night makes your pillow
nice and soft for you so you can sleep well.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg&nbsp;14]</a></span>
She seems to know just what to do if we
happen to get hurt.</p>

</div>

<p class="caption">A MOTHER LIVES FOR HER CHILDREN</p>

<p>Mother is watching after her little
ones all the day long, and when she puts
her hand upon our heads at night as we
bow at her knee in prayer, she seems to
say, &ldquo;God bless and keep my darling child.&rdquo;
When she tucks the covers tight about us
and sits by our bedside, we think that Mama
is the best friend we have. Don&rsquo;t we?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg&nbsp;16]</a></span>
Now I will tell you of another friend. This
friend lives in heaven. His name is God.
We can not see God, but he looks down
from heaven and sees us. He sees everything
we do, and hears everything we say.
He knows all things.</p>

<p>It was God who made this earth where we
live, and everything that has life. We pray
to God, and he hears us and answers our
prayers.</p>

<h2>The Good Book</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE Bible is a good book. In it we read
about God, and about his making the
earth, sun, moon, stars, trees, flowers, rocks,
water, birds, fishes, animals, and man.</p>

<p>We read of Adam and Eve, the first man
and woman; of their beautiful home, the
Garden of Eden; and also of their children
and their children&rsquo;s children.</p>

<p>In it there are many, many stories about
how God helped people in times of trial.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg&nbsp;17]</a></span>
We also read about Jesus, the Son of
God, who came down from heaven and died
for us, that we might have eternal life.</p>

<p>Good men wrote the Bible long, long ago,
and the contents have been kept, until now
we all have Bibles. The Bible is called Holy
Bible because it is God&rsquo;s Word, and is a record
of God&rsquo;s work and God&rsquo;s words.</p>

<p>If we live now as the Bible teaches, after
we die we shall receive a crown of life in
heaven.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg&nbsp;18]</a></span></p>

<h2>What God Made</h2>


<p><span class="dropcapo"><span class="dropcaps">O</span></span>UR God is a very great
God. He made all things. He made this earth where we now live.</p>

<p>It seems strange that there was a time, many, many years ago, when
this earth was nowhere to be found; but that is so.</p>

<p>When men make things, they must have
tools to work with. They have to make
things little by little, working at them a long
time before they are done.</p>

<p>It was not so with God when he made
this earth. &ldquo;He spake, and it was done.&rdquo;
At first all was dark. He then said, &ldquo;Let
there be light,&rdquo; and it was light. He called
the light day, and the darkness he called
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg&nbsp;19]</a></span>
night. This, the Good Book says, took place
on the first day.</p>

<p>On the second day God made the air we
breathe, and in which the birds fly.</p>

<p>On the third day he made the land, sea, and rivers, and
the grass, flowers, and trees.</p>

<p>On the fourth day he made the sun, moon, and stars, to
give light to the earth by day and night.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 195px;">
<img src="images/lotcp09.jpg" width="195" height="250"
alt="A bird perches on a branch." />
</div>

<p>On the fifth day he made the fish that
swim in the water and the birds that fly in
the air.</p>

<p>On the sixth day he made all the animals,
and at last he made man. He gave them for
food the grain of the fields, the fruits of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg&nbsp;20]</a></span>
trees, and the vegetables of the garden.</p>

<p>On the seventh day God rested &ldquo;from all
the work which he had made.&rdquo; &ldquo;And God
saw everything that he had made, and, behold,
it was very good.&rdquo;</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<h2>In the Garden of Eden</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>HEN the Garden of Eden was planted
with all the beautiful flowers and
trees, God gave it to Adam for a home. He
told him to take good care of it. Adam
was glad to work in the garden and use it
as he chose; but he had no one to enjoy the
things that he enjoyed, no one to help him
to be just what God wished him to be, no
one to love.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/lotcp10.jpg" width="400" height="142"
alt="A field containing some sheep, with trees here and there." />
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg&nbsp;21]</a></span>
God said, &ldquo;It is not good that the man
should be alone: I will make him an help
meet for him.&rdquo; So he made a woman and
Adam called her Eve.</p>

<p>Eve was very much like Adam in some
ways, yet unlike him in other ways. Man
has some gifts that woman does not have;
one is helpful to the other.</p>

<p>Adam&rsquo;s heart must have been glad to see
the woman whom God had made for him.
He now had some one to enjoy the home
with him. Adam and Eve were happy in
Eden as long as they loved God more than
they loved to have their own way. He knew
better than they did what was good for them
and what would make them happy, and
they were glad to obey him.</p>

<p>But by and by their own way seemed better
than God&rsquo;s way, and they did things that
God had said they should not do. When
we do things that God says we should not
do, we sin. So Adam and Eve sinned, and
were ashamed to see God, and when he came
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg&nbsp;22]</a></span>
into the garden, they hid among the trees.</p>

<h2>Our Heavenly Home</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">G</span>OD loves men too well to leave them
in sin and sorrow. And though we
have sinned, he will forgive us if we are
sorry for our sins and ask his pardon. He
will give us good thoughts, and help us to
love him and to love one another.</p>

<p>We shall all die, but we shall live again;
and if we serve God in this life and are
Christians, we shall live with him in heaven.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg&nbsp;23]</a></span>
There we shall never sin and never die. We
shall never be sick or sad; we shall be happy
forever. There we shall see God. Jesus
will be there, and so will all the good
people who have ever lived.</p>

<p>God saw that the people he had made
were doing wrong, and he had pity on the
whole world of sinners. So he sent his
only Son to this earth as the Savior of the
world. You will find somewhere in this
book how God&rsquo;s Son came to this world.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<h2>The Day and Night</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">G</span>OD made the sun to give light by day.
The sun not only gives us light, but
also makes the earth warm and causes everything
to grow.</p>

<p>Sometimes when the sun rises in the
morning, it looks very close, but it is really
far away&mdash;away off in the sky. When the
sun goes down in the evening, darkness
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg&nbsp;24]</a></span>
comes all around us. This is called night.</p>

<p>We do not want all daytime, in which to
work and play; neither do we want all nighttime,
in which to sleep; but we enjoy both
the day and the night as God made them.</p>

</div>

<p>Also, we see the moon and the stars.
When the moon is full and round, how large
and pretty it looks! God made the moon
and stars to shine at night. Have you ever
noticed the stars twinkle at night? How
pretty they are! There are so many of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg&nbsp;25]</a></span>
them that we could never count them all.
At one time some shepherds saw a beautiful
large star; it was a sign that the Savior of
the world was born.</p>

<h2>The Rain and the Snow</h2>


<div class="poem">

</div>
</div>

<p>I think it is pleasant to sit by the window
and watch the rain as it falls, sometimes in
tiny drops and sometimes in large ones.</p>

<p>The warm showers make the grass, trees,
and flowers grow. After the shower is over,
the grass looks fresh and green.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg&nbsp;27]</a></span>
The birds also seem to be glad for the
rain. They chirp among the trees when the
shower is over.</p>

<p>We see the pretty clouds in the sky. The
wind moves them about. Sometimes a storm
comes, and then we see the lightning and
hear the thunder.</p>

<p>When winter-time comes, it gets cold, and
the ground is all covered with pure-white
crystals of snow. Everything looks so clean
and pretty with its white coat on. We see
the little snowbirds flying around, and they
are so happy picking up seeds for food.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg&nbsp;28]</a></span>
Then we love to get on our mittens and
warm coats, and go out in the snow, too.
People hitch horses to sleighs and enjoy
rides. They put bells on the horses, and
these jingle merrily when the horses go fast.</p>

<p>In the far north it gets very cold, and
when the people go anywhere, they hitch
dogs to sleds.</p>

<p>In the Bible we read that the Lord will
make our hearts white as snow if we confess
our sins and take him for our Savior.</p>

You may have helped your papa or mama
plant seeds in the garden or in the flowerbed.
The warm sun and the rain make them
grow rapidly.</p>

<p>We do not plant weed-seeds, but in some way they
get into the ground, and come up along with the garden-plants.
If the weeds are not cut out, they will crowd out the
good plants.</p>

<p class="caption">AN ACT OF KINDNESS</p>

<p>When we do little acts of kindness, it is
like planting good seed. When we are not
kind, and say bad words, it is like letting the
weeds crowd out the good plants.</p>

<p>If you are good and kind to papa and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg&nbsp;36]</a></span>
mama, brother or sister, today, you will find
it easy to be kind to them tomorrow. It
makes you happy to be good to those around
you.</p>

<p>If you are cross and say bad words, you
may want to say them again. You can not
feel happy when you have said and done
bad things.</p>

<p>God can help you sow good seed. He will
help you to be good. He will help you to
love all around you.</p>

<h2>Flowers of Springtime</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">H</span>OW pretty and sweet are the apple,
peach, pear, plum, cherry, and orange
blossoms! How good God was to make all
these things for us to see and smell! We
can enjoy the blossoms. Also, we can see
the little apples or other fruit grow until
they become large, juicy, ripe fruit. Then
we can eat them, and oh, how good they will
taste! God is very good to us.</p>

<p>Not a leaf nor a blade of grass could grow
if God&rsquo;s hand did not care for it. He causes
the warm sun to shine and the gentle rains
to fall so that everything can grow. Things
could not grow without the warm sun and
the rain.</p>

<p>God has caused the wild flowers to grow
along the road-side and in the woods and
meadows so we can enjoy them. How glad
we should be that we have such a good God
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg&nbsp;38]</a></span>
to worship! When we kneel to pray, we can
say, &ldquo;O Lord, I thank thee for all the pretty
things I see each day.&rdquo; The pretty things
are some of the blessings that he daily
gives us.</p>

<h2>A Walk in the Woods</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">H</span>AVE you ever taken a walk through

<p>It is delightful to go through the woods
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg&nbsp;39]</a></span>
where you can see the beautiful trees. You
can nearly always find some flowers growing
along the edge of the brook. Besides,
the little birds fly among the trees and sing
so sweetly. Almost any child would enjoy
a walk through the woods. But there are
many children in large cities who never
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg&nbsp;40]</a></span>
have the pleasure of going to the woods.</p>

<h2>Our Feathered Friends</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>HEN all the trees and bushes and
grass are green in the spring, we see
the little birds and hear their sweet songs.</p>

<p>How happy they seem as they fly about
from tree to tree, and scratch in the ground
to find little seeds and
insects to eat!</p>

<p>Sometimes we find a bird&rsquo;s nest in the bushes
or on the ground. God teaches the little birds
how to build their nests with small sticks, leaves,
and feathers.</p>

<p>This is the bird&rsquo;s house. We sometimes
see tiny eggs in the nest. The little eggs hatch,
and then there are little birdies in the nest
in place of the eggs. The mother bird hunts
worms and bugs to feed the little ones.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 127px;">

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg&nbsp;42]</a></span>
Did you ever see a nest of young birds?
How they open their little mouths when you
come near! They think you have something
for them to eat.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 173px;">
<img src="images/lotcp26.jpg" width="173" height="250"
alt="A bird perching in a tree." />
</div>

<p>Once a little boy found a meadow-lark&rsquo;s
nest with young birds in it. As they opened their
little mouths, he thought he could feed them better
than the mother bird. He decided to raise them for
pets, and so carried them
home. He fed them bread; but as the little
birds were not used to that kind of food,
they did not thrive on it; and when one day
the boy forgot to feed them, they died. How
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg&nbsp;43]</a></span>
sad he felt! And how sad the mother bird
must have felt when she could not find her
babies!</p>

<p>God made the birds to enjoy the woods
and fields. We must not destroy their nests,
for that would be wrong.</p>

<p>The Bible says, &ldquo;Behold the fowls of the
air: for they sow not, neither do they reap,
nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly
Father feedeth them.&rdquo;</p>

</div>

<p><span class="dropcap">D</span>ID you ever see an owl? Owls fly
around at night, as they can see better
after dark than in the daytime. They
stay in some dark and quiet spot all day, unless
disturbed, but at night they hunt around
for something to eat. They eat some kinds
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg&nbsp;45]</a></span>
of birds, rats, mice, fish, reptiles, and insects.</p>

<p>The nest of the owl is made of sticks and
twigs, and is oftentimes built in rocks or
ruins or old houses.</p>

<p>Some owls are as white as snow, and their
feathers are as soft as cotton. Some are
brown, and others are gray.</p>

<p>Sometimes in the night we hear their
noise, which sounds much as if they were
saying, &ldquo;Who? who? who?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The owl can not turn his eyes about as we
can; so when he wants to look around, he
must turn his head.</p>

<p>In the cold countries where snow stays
upon the ground most of the time, there are
owls with pure-white feathers. They are
very large, too; yet they can hardly be seen,
since they look so much like the snow.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">C</span>HICKENS and ducks

<p>Ducks and geese love to swim in the water.
Both the big and the little
ones can swim, but chickens
can not.</p>

<p>The old mother hen
sometimes has many little
chicks running around her.
They stay pretty close, because they are
afraid that something might harm them.</p>

<p>Chicks are sometimes caught by hawks,
which fly around watching for them. In
the picture we see a dog driving a hawk
away from the old hen and chickens. Don&rsquo;t
you think he is a good dog?</p>

<p>A farmer had a dog whose name was
Ring. Even though he was asleep, if a
chicken gave the note of alarm, he would
jump up and bark at once. Then he would
run after the hawk and drive it away.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">F</span>ISHES are queer

in water. Men catch them
with hooks and lines or

<p>Some fish are very large. We read in the
Bible of a man named Jonah. He was trying
to run away from the Lord, who had called
him to a work. While on a ship, during a
storm he was thrown into the water. But he did
not drown, for a great
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg&nbsp;52]</a></span>
fish swallowed him, and carried him ashore.
He then knew that God meant what he said,
and so did as God had commanded.</p>

<p>There are hundreds of different kinds of
fishes, and many, many men earn their living
by catching and selling them for food.</p>

<p>Some of Christ&rsquo;s disciples were fishermen
when he called them. He told them that he
would make them fishers of men. This
meant that he would prepare them to help
other people to become Christians.</p>

<h2>Our Tame Animals</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HERE are some kinds of animals that
are tame, as the sheep, hog, cow,
horse, dog, and cat.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg&nbsp;53]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 396px;">
<img src="images/lotcp40.jpg" width="396" height="500"
alt="A cat sits looking up at a little girl, who is holding a bowl." />
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg&nbsp;54]</a></span>
The horse is a faithful beast and does
much work for man. He draws the heavy
loads on the road and works in the fields.
We hitch him to a wagon or a carriage and
enjoy a ride, or we can put a saddle upon his
back and ride there also.</p>

<p>The cow gives us milk for our food, and
from the milk we get cream, butter, and
cheese.</p>

<p>The flesh of the hog is valuable for food.</p>

<p>The dogs are useful to guard our homes,
and cats catch mice and rats. Both dogs
and cats make good pets.</p>

<p>Sheep have long wool all over their
bodies, and men cut it off and use it to make
clothes to keep us warm.</p>

<p>Young sheep are called lambs. They like
to run and play very much. In the picture
we see a lamb that has fallen into the water.
The mother sheep stands close by and
watches the man trying to pull the lamb out.</p>

<p>I suppose the man had missed these two
from the flock. He was in search of the lost
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg&nbsp;55]</a></span>
ones, and seeing the mother standing near
the water, he came and found the lamb
nearly drowned. The mother would not
leave her babe, but waited a long time until
help came.</p>

<img src="images/lotcp41.jpg" width="292" height="400"

</div>

<p>Lambs are innocent-looking animals, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg&nbsp;56]</a></span>
do not make a noise when hurt. Jesus said
that children are his lambs.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<h2>Little Foxes</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">F</span>OXES are wild animals. They live in
the woods and swamps, in places where
not many people live.</p>

<p>They are very cunning and sly, and catch
young chickens, ducks, turkeys, and geese
whenever they can.</p>

<p>Night is the time when they slip around
and catch these barnyard fowls. They
carry the fowls off to their holes in the
ground, and eat them there.</p>

<p>Little foxes are very destructive, and
often spoil grape-vines. In the Bible we read
that it is the little foxes that spoil the vines.</p>

<p>This also means that our little unkind
words and actions spoil the peace in our
lives and make us feel bad.</p>

<p>Let us be careful that our words and
deeds do not make ourselves or others
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg&nbsp;58]</a></span>
unhappy. If we live to please God, we shall
please God&rsquo;s people, and we shall not have
to feel sorry on account of some bad words
said or deeds done.</p>

<h2>The Squirrels</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>HEN the frosts have colored the
leaves of the trees of the woods with
many hues, and the nuts have ripened and
fallen to the ground, it is then that the squirrels
gather a good supply of the different
kinds of nuts and acorns into their little
homes in the hollow trees, to be eaten during
the many long days of winter.</p>

<p>Have you ever seen a squirrel? They
love to play in the woods, and run among
the branches of the trees, and jump from
one limb to another.</p>

<p>God made the squirrels to enjoy the
woods, and he has provided the nuts for
them to eat.</p>

sheep. During the day
he watches them while

<p>Now, we read in the
Bible that an angel of
the Lord appeared to some shepherds in the
night. The shepherds were very much
afraid, but the angel said to them:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good
tidings of great joy, which shall be to all
people. For unto you is born this day in the
city of David a Savior, which is Christ the
Lord. And this shall be a sign unto you;
Ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling-clothes,
lying in a manger.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">G</span>OD, who is in heaven, was full of pity
for the unhappy people of earth. He
loved them so much that he sent his Son to
the earth in the form of a child, a baby
in his mother&rsquo;s arms. He came to earth
to show us how to obey God&mdash;how to live
so as to do good in this life and be happy
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg&nbsp;63]</a></span>
both in this life and in the life to come.</p>

<p>He came as a child, so as to show children
how to live. He came like other children,
and grew up as other children do, only better
and wiser.</p>

<p>When God sent his Son to the earth, he
gave him into the care of two good people
who lived in a small town called Nazareth.</p>

There was no room for them in the
inn; so they had to stay in a place made for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg&nbsp;64]</a></span>
cattle. God was not ashamed to place his
Son in the care of poor people. He was
not ashamed to have him born in a stable
and cradled in a manger.</p>

<p>A bright star appeared over the place
where the young child lay, and by this sign
the wise men that came from the east seeking
him were enabled to find him.</p>

<h2>The Good Shepherd</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">J</span>ESUS once lived on this very same earth
on which we live. He walked through
grain-fields. He climbed mountains. He
noticed the birds and flowers, and watched
the fishermen and farmers and shepherds.
He used the things he saw to teach lessons to his
disciples and others who came to hear him.</p>

</div>

<p>In the land of Palestine, where he lived,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg&nbsp;65]</a></span>
sheep-raising was very common. He said at
one time: &ldquo;I am the good Shepherd, and
know my sheep. My sheep hear my voice,
and they follow me.&rdquo;</p>

Jesus went into meeting-houses and

<h2>Parable of the Sower</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">J</span>ESUS taught many spiritual lessons by
parables, that is, by stories about the
common things people could understand.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 248px;">
<img src="images/lotcp53.jpg" width="248" height="300"
alt="A man sowing seeds in a field." />
</div>

<p>One day as he sat by the sea of Galilee, he
told the people the parable of the Sower.
The sower cast some seed by the wayside,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg&nbsp;71]</a></span>
that is, along the edge of the field or road-side.
Some seed fell upon stony ground,
some among thorns, and some on good
ground.</p>

<p>The people did not know what he meant
till he explained the lesson to them.</p>

<p>The great sower is Jesus, but all Christians
are sowers under him. The seed is the
Word of God. People&rsquo;s hearts are the four
kinds of soil.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<h2>Parable of the Leaven</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>MONG the stories that Jesus told was
the parable of the leaven.</p>

<p>A woman put leaven in the flour as a
baker puts yeast in his bread dough. The
leaven kept working until it affected all the
dough and made it rise and become light.</p>

<p>As the yeast or leaven goes through all
the dough, so the gospel of Jesus will go to
all the nations in the world.</p>

<p>Each one who believes on Jesus enters the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg&nbsp;72]</a></span>
kingdom of God. The kingdom of God is
righteousness, peace, and joy, which we get
when we become Christians.</p>

<h2>Laborers in the Vineyard</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">J</span>ESUS told another parable, a story of the
laborers in the vineyard. You can turn
in your Testament to Matthew 20:1-16, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg&nbsp;73]</a></span>
read about the man who hired laborers to
work in his vineyard.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 249px;">
<img src="images/lotcp55.jpg" width="249" height="300"
alt="A number of men outside a building wait while two other men talk together." />
</div>

<p>He had agreed to pay the laborers a penny
a day. The men who worked all day thought
they should receive more than those hired
later in the day, but the master paid them
all alike. Just so those of us who have been
Christians only a short time will receive the
same heavenly reward as those who have
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg&nbsp;74]</a></span>
lived a Christian life for years. Salvation
is just the same to all&mdash;it takes sin out of
our hearts and fills them with the love of
God.</p>

<p>We must not put off getting saved; for
Jesus said, &ldquo;Watch, for ye know not the
hour when your Lord doth come.&rdquo; This
means that we are liable to die without a
warning, and we should always be ready.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<h2>The Wicked Husbandmen</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>NOTHER parable is about a man who
had a vineyard and let it out to husbandmen.
When the time for gathering
grapes came, he sent his servants to the
husbandmen that they might receive the
fruit. But the husbandmen took his servants
and beat one and killed another. He
sent other servants, and they were treated
in the same way.</p>

<p>Last of all he sent his son, thinking they
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg&nbsp;75]</a></span>
would honor him, but they caught him and
killed him.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 248px;">
<img src="images/lotcp56.jpg" width="248" height="300"
alt="A group of three men, one holding a club, wait for another man." />
</div>

<p>Jesus spoke this parable to the wicked
people about himself at that time. Christ
himself had been sent to the Jews, who had
been the people of God for ages past, but
who had wandered into sin. From time to
time God had sent good prophets to warn
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg&nbsp;76]</a></span>
the Jews, but often the prophets were persecuted.</p>

<p>At last God sent Jesus, his only Son, and
him they killed.</p>

<h2>The Wheat and the Tares</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">C</span>HRIST told another parable. It was of
a man who sowed good seed in his
field; but while the servants slept, an enemy
came and sowed tares, or weeds, and then
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg&nbsp;77]</a></span>
went away so that the servants knew nothing
of it.</p>

<p>When the wheat grew, the tares also grew.
When the servants noticed the tares, they
asked the owner what it meant, as they
sowed only good seed. He answered that
an enemy had sown the tares. But he said
that they should let both grow till the harvest,
and that then the tares would be gathered
and burned, but the wheat gathered
into the barn.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/lotcp59.jpg" width="250" height="80"
alt="A wheat field, half of it cut and stacked in sheaves." />
</div>

<p>Jesus explained this: The field, he said,
means the world; the owner means Jesus
himself; the wheat means the persons who
become Christians; the tares are sowed by
Satan; and the weeds are wicked men.</p>

<p>The wicked men and Christians are together
here in this world, but at the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg&nbsp;78]</a></span>
judgment-day the righteous will go to heaven
and the wicked will be punished.</p>

<h2>The King&rsquo;s Marriage-Feast</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>NOTHER parable was of a king&rsquo;s marriage-feast.</p>

<p>The king invited certain ones to the feast,
but they would not come; so he made an
open invitation and sent his servants into
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg&nbsp;79]</a></span>
the highways to invite as many as they could
find, and these people came.</p>

<p>God sent Jesus to the world, and he invited
the Jews to accept the kingdom of
God, but they would not. Though some
Jews accepted Jesus, yet as a nation they
did not, and God was displeased with them
for it. When the Jews would not accept
Jesus, God extended the invitation to the
Gentiles, or all other people.</p>

<p>God now has the feast prepared. He invites
people to come to Jesus and have their
hearts made pure and enjoy the rich blessings
of the kingdom&mdash;righteousness, joy,
and peace. He extends the invitation to all.</p>

<p>If we will not give heed to his invitation
to accept Jesus, we shall be left out of the
kingdom, and others will take our place.</p>

<h2>A Lesson on Forgiveness</h2>

<img src="images/lotcp62.jpg" width="249" height="300"
alt="A man kneels before a king sitting on a throne; a group of guards are in the background." />
</div>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE man kneeling in the picture owed
the king hundreds and hundreds of
dollars. He had no money to pay the king.
The king said that this man and his wife
and children must be sold and the money
used to pay the debt. The man begged the
king to wait a while, promising that by and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg&nbsp;81]</a></span>
by he would give him the money. The king
then felt sorry for the poor man and said
the man would not need to pay him any
money. The man arose and walked away.</p>

<p>Soon he met a friend who owed him a little
money. He spoke harshly to the friend
and told him to pay the money. The friend
did not have any money. He kneeled down
before the man and said, &ldquo;Wait a while,
and by and by I will give you the money.&rdquo;
But the man seemed to have forgotten that
the king had been kind to him. He had the
friend put in jail. When the king heard
about this, he did not like it, and he punished
the hard-hearted man.</p>

<p>We are like the man in the picture. We
ask God to be good to us and forgive us
when we do wrong. Then, maybe, we are
not good to our little friends when they do
wrong to us. If they do a bad thing to us,
we want to pay them back. We should not
do this way. Jesus said that if we would
not forgive others, God would not forgive
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg&nbsp;82]</a></span>
us. To forgive our friends means to be just
as good to them when they do wrong to us
as when they do good to us.</p>

<h2>Jesus Loves the Children</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>T ONE time when Jesus was teaching
the people, some women brought their
children to him for a blessing. The disciples
thought the women should not do this, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg&nbsp;83]</a></span>
thought Jesus did not wish to be bothered
with the children.</p>

<p>Jesus said, &ldquo;Suffer little children, and
forbid them not, to come unto me; for of
such is the kingdom of heaven.&rdquo; He loved
them and held them upon his lap and blessed
them.</p>

<img src="images/lotcp64.jpg" width="250" height="129"
alt="A group of men listen to Jesus." />
</div>

<p>At another time he said that unless people
become converted and become as little
children, they can not enter the kingdom of
heaven. This means that it is necessary for
them to have their sins forgiven and to be
pure and innocent and free from sin in order
to be in God&rsquo;s church in this world and to
go to heaven after they die.</p>

At one time he went into the meeting-place
of the Jews and saw a man there who
had a hand so withered that he could not
open it or stretch it out. Now, there was a
Jewish law that said no work should be
done on the Sabbath. The wicked people
watched Jesus to see if he would heal this
man on the Sabbath-day.</p>

<p>Jesus knew their thoughts, and so he
asked the people, &ldquo;If any of you had a sheep
which should fall into a pit on the Sabbath,
would you not help it out?&rdquo; Then he said
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg&nbsp;86]</a></span>
that if it was right to help a sheep, it was
much more so to be good to man.</p>

<p>After that he said to the man, &ldquo;Stretch
out your hand,&rdquo; and he stretched it out.</p>

<h2>Jesus Nearing Jerusalem</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>NE day Jesus and his disciples were
on their way to a great city. This
city was Jerusalem. Jesus told them that
there many cruel things would be done to
him and that he would be killed.</p>

<p>The disciples did not think this would
happen to Jesus. They thought he would be
a great king and sit on a throne. Two of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg&nbsp;87]</a></span>
these men were James and John. They
came with their mother and bowed before
Jesus as you see in the picture. James and
John wanted to be great. They asked Jesus
to let one of them sit on the right side
and the other on the left of his throne. Jesus
told them that the way to be great was
to do good, kind deeds.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/lotcp68.jpg" width="250" height="300"
alt="James and John, with their mother, kneel before Jesus." />
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg&nbsp;88]</a></span>
Jesus was the greatest person who has
ever lived, and he spent all his life doing
good to those who were in need of help.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 218px;">
<img src="images/lotcp69.jpg" width="218" height="250"
alt="The blind men, with some others, wait by the roadside as Jesus approaches." />
</div>

<p>As Jesus and his men went toward
the city, many people went with him.
Two blind men were sitting by the
road. They heard the crowd coming.
When they knew that Jesus was coming,
they asked him to open their eyes. Jesus
was always ready to help those who were
in trouble. He opened the eyes of the two
blind men so they could see.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<h2>Jesus Changed</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">M</span>ANY little boys and girls kneel down
at mama&rsquo;s knee or by the bed in the
evening and pray to God. Often Jesus went
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg&nbsp;89]</a></span>
up on a high hill to pray. In the picture
Jesus is on a hill-top. He went there to
pray. He took three of his disciples with
him. They were Peter, James, and John.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 253px;">
<img src="images/lotcp70.jpg" width="253" height="300"
alt="The three disciples kneel in front of Jesus and the two men with him." />
</div>

<p>See the two men by the side of Jesus, and
see how bright Jesus looks. The two men
came from heaven to talk with Jesus. Peter,
James, and John had never seen Jesus look
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg&nbsp;90]</a></span>
so beautiful before. The Bible says that his
face shone like the sun and that his clothes
looked bright like snow when the sun shines
upon it.</p>

<p>The three disciples heard God&rsquo;s voice.
The voice said, &ldquo;This is my beloved Son, in
whom I am well pleased; hear ye him.&rdquo;
When they heard it, they fell on their faces,
for they were afraid.</p>

<p>Soon the two men went away, and Jesus
looked as he did before. He touched his
disciples and told them not to be afraid.</p>

<p>Then they went down the hill. They
found many people. They saw a poor boy
who was sick, and Jesus made him well.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<h2>Feeding the Multitude</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>HEN Jesus was here on earth, he
preached to the people, and many
listened to his words. He went from place
to place talking of God, healing the sick
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg&nbsp;91]</a></span>
and lame, and doing much good everywhere
he went.</p>

<p>At one time when he had been preaching
to about five thousand people for a long
time, they all became hungry. There was
no food for the people to eat, except five
small loaves of bread and two small fishes.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/lotcp71.jpg" width="300" height="191"
alt="Jesus with the multitude." />
</div>

<p>But Jesus blessed the bread and broke it
and gave it to the people. They all had all
they wanted, and there was a good portion
left.</p>

<p>Jesus was the Son of God, and anything
he said would be done. So it was with the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg&nbsp;92]</a></span>
bread. He multiplied it, so that the people
were all satisfied.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/lotcp72.jpg" width="300" height="400"
alt="Jesus walks along, talking with some of his disciples." />
</div>

<p>In the Bible we read: &ldquo;Jesus
Christ the same yesterday, and
today, and forever.&rdquo; This
means that he has just as
much power today and can do as much for us
as he did when he was here upon earth.</p>

<h2>The Death of Jesus</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">M</span>ANY were the good deeds done by Jesus
while he was here on earth, and
many people believed on him and followed
him.</p>

<img src="images/lotcp73.jpg" width="300" height="235"
alt="Jesus kneels, hands clasped as if in prayer." />
</div>

<p>Some very wicked men did not like Jesus
and abused him whenever they could.
Just before they killed him, they put a crown
of thorns on his head, and the sharp points
pierced his brow and were very painful.</p>

<p>He was nailed to a large cross, and
was left there until he died. Some
good men buried him in a stone tomb,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg&nbsp;94]</a></span>
but in three days he arose and afterwards
he went up
to heaven.</p>

<img src="images/lotcp74.jpg" width="211" height="250"
alt="Jesus on the cross; two men sit and talk in the foreground." />
</div>

<p>He died for our sins, so that
we can be saved from our sins
in this life and go to live
with him when we die.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<h2>Jesus Our Savior</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>UR Savior is Jesus. He died to save
us from our sins in this world, and to
save us from eternal death when we die.</p>

<p>Suppose that a girl should be out on the
water in a boat and should fall out of it into
the water, and some men close by with a
large boat would get to her right away; they
would save her life, would they not? Yes.</p>

<p>Just so Jesus came to save us. We were
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg&nbsp;95]</a></span>
lost because we all have sinned and disobeyed
God, but we can be saved from our
sins if we ask Jesus to forgive us. He will
forgive our sins and will not hold them
against us any more.</p>

<p>When our sins are forgiven, we are Christians,
and Jesus will help us to live right
from that time on.</p>

<p class="caption">GOING UP TO HEAVEN</p>

<p>We shall not have a desire to do the bad
things which so many boys and girls do,
but we shall want to live right and be good.</p>

<p>He can keep us from sin every day and
hour if we trust him. So Jesus is our Savior.</p>

<h2>Moments of Prayer</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">H</span>OW good it is that all can pray! The
Lord is always waiting to hear and
answer our prayers. When we pray, we talk
with God; we must listen closely when he
talks to us and do whatever he says.</p>

alt="A little girl and a little boy kneel in prayer beside a bed." />
</div>

<p>When we get ready for bed in the evening,
we should not forget to pray. We
should remember that the Lord has been
good to us all the day long. He has kept
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg&nbsp;97]</a></span>
us from all harm, and given us food and
clothes. We should also thank him for a
home and parents and friends. Even the
air we breathe comes from him.</p>

<p>Then in the morning we should again
kneel down, and thank God for his care
through the night. The Lord loves to hear
children pray.</p>

<p>After we pray, we should try hard to be
good. The Lord will surely help us if we
ask him. Then, do not forget to pray.</p>

<h2>Visit the Sick</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">D</span>O YOU not know some one who is sick?
Some little boy or girl may be in bed
with a fever, and would be so glad to see
you come into the room with a bunch of
flowers or some other little gift. How happy
the sick one would be!</p>

<p>Are you not glad to see your friends when
you are sick? It makes you forget some of
your pain for a time, does it not?</p>

<p>When we give a bunch of flowers to a
friend, a teacher, or some one who is sick,
it is the same as saving, &ldquo;I love you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Can you not get a good book and show the
sick ones some pictures, or read to them?
You can read about Jesus, who had pity on
all the sick and healed them.</p>

<p>Jesus was very kind, and was glad to
take away the aches and pains when the
people came to him.</p>

<p>He had great power to heal all kinds of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg&nbsp;103]</a></span>
sickness, and in several places in the Bible
we read that &ldquo;he healed all the sick&rdquo; that
came to him.</p>

ask for his healing power. Jesus can do all
things.</p>

<p>He can do many things for us if we live
true to him, and ask him for the things that
we need as we would ask mama for a piece
of bread or cake. Jesus never fails to supply
our needs if we are his true children and
live for him. Let us have faith in God.</p>

he clothe you, O ye of little faith?&rdquo;</p>

<p>God takes care of the flowers, the grass,
and the trees, and he can care for us.</p>

<img src="images/lotcp87.jpg" width="274" height="400"
alt="A little boy stands beside a garden gate." />
</div>

<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>NE time a little boy was sent by his
papa to plant some beans. He worked
a while, then he sat down to play. While he
was playing, he spilled part of his beans.
At once he began to pick them up.</p>

<p>There were so many beans that he became
tired. Then he thought he could cover them
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg&nbsp;116]</a></span>
up with dirt. He thought no one would ever
know he had spilled them. At last he got
the rest of the beans planted and went
home.</p>

<p>He often thought of the beans he had
spilled. But he did not tell his papa. Some
time after this his papa went to the patch.
He wanted to see how the beans were growing.
He found that all of them had come
up&mdash;even those that the boy had spilled and
had not picked up. The boy did not need to
tell his papa then what he had done. For
his papa knew it all.</p>

<p>So it is with some bad things you may
have done. You may think that no one
will ever know of them. But the secret will
come out some time. Even if no person
should ever find it out, God sees all you
do. You can not hide anything from him.</p>

<h2>Be Kind to the Aged</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>NE fine spring day six children went
to the woods to gather wild flowers.
Oh, how they enjoyed the warm sunshine
while they filled their little baskets with violets,
buttercups, and spring beauties! And
the air was filled with the sweet perfume.</p>

<p class="caption">KIND TO THE AGED</p>

<p>The flowers were so pretty and there were
so many that the children could hardly stop
when the baskets were filled. Soon they
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg&nbsp;118]</a></span>
started for home. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s give some flowers
to the old people,&rdquo; said one. &ldquo;Yes, let&rsquo;s
do,&rdquo; said the rest, and off they went, and
many were the smiles from the old people
that day.</p>

<p>Let us be kind to the aged. When we
meet any one who is old, let us speak to them
kindly and give them a smile.</p>

<h2>A Baby for a Nickel</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">A</span> MAN told a little girl that he would
sell his baby for a nickel. She liked
babies well and thought that was very
cheap. She ran home quickly to get the
money. Her mama was very busy. She
gave her the nickel and did not stop to listen
to what the little girl wanted.</p>

<p>The little girl ran back to the man to get
the baby. Of course, the man would not
give up his baby. He did not mean what he
had said. This made the little girl cry very
hard.</p>

<p>Her mama always told the truth. She
thought others meant what they said, just
like her mama.</p>

<p>It was wrong for the man not to tell the
truth. We often make others feel very bad
when we say things that we do not mean.</p>

<h2>We All Must Die</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">S</span>OME people are very wicked. This
means that they do many bad things
and do not love God. Some men swear and
lie and steal and also do other sinful things.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">

</div>

<p class="caption">MARILYN&rsquo;S TEACHER TELLS HER OF
THE HEAVENLY HOME</p>

<p>To tell a lie is to say things that are not
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg&nbsp;123]</a></span>
true, and to steal is to take something that
belongs to some one else.</p>

<p>Now, it is very wrong to swear, lie, or
steal. God does not want us to do any such
things. All who do wicked things will some
day be punished.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 293px;">
<img src="images/lotcp93.jpg" width="293" height="400"
alt="A man is in a rowing boat on a raging river; his oars have broken." />
</div>

<p>Some day we shall die, for all of us must
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg&nbsp;124]</a></span>
die. If a man should be going some place
through the deep snow and should get lost
and the cold should freeze him, it would kill
him. He would not live any longer, but
would be dead.</p>

<p>If we love God and live for him, he will
give us a home in heaven after we die; but
if we are wicked, we shall be lost and punished
for our wicked ways after we die.</p>

<p>We should think about our life here and
see that we live to please God.</p>

<p>If we do not, when we come to die we may
be like the man in the boat. At one time he
could have been saved&mdash;while he was floating
on the smooth waters. But he has let
it go too far, and can only look forward to
his doom.</p>

<p>Let us love God and live for him on earth,
so we can live with him in heaven after we
die. When Christ was here on earth he
said: &ldquo;I go to prepare a place for you, ...
that where I am, there ye may be also.&rdquo;</p>
